# Deep Learning based Sensor Fusion for 6-DoF Pose Estimation

Predicting vehicle position and orientation based on GPS and IMU sensor measurements.

1. generate simulation data with [generateData/generateSimulationData.ipynb](generateData/generateSimulationData.ipynb)
2. train a neural network with [train_simulation.ipynb](train_simulation.ipynb)
